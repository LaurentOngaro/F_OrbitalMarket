<i>Enhanced marketplace platform for the Unreal Engine marketplace</i>
</p>

## Description

**Orbital Market** is a project to improve the Unreal Engine marketplace.
It's basically a fast search engine with a lot of options.

**Orbital Market** is accessible here: https://orbital-market.com/

## Documentation

The products are updated automatically by a script using the Unreal Engine marketplace API.
This script is fired manually, but will soon be fired automatically with a CRON at 2am GMT+0.

If you are a seller, putting a link to your **Orbital Market** card in your products description will be greatly appreciated!
If you do so, you'll get a score boost of 10%, and a small highlight on your products.

## Contribution / Licence

Contribution will be greatly appreciated once the project is in a more advanced stage. (For now, I'm just committing to the main branch without any proper PR...).

**Orbital Market** is unlicensed for now (all rights are reserved).
